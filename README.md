# ScreamBot

This is the code and hardware specs for ScreamBot, the newest innovation in stupid BS science.

ScreamBot is a small robot that uses Haar Cascades to look for humans. It then screams. A lot of the code came from https://realpython.com/face-detection-in-python-using-a-webcam/ and https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/. Thanks RealPython, you helped a ton!

# Software Things
We used Rasbian Linux as the OS on the ***c o r t e x*** of our bot. All scripts were coded in python 3. Thats all the software I guess.

# Hardware Thigns
Hardware we used:

1. Raspberry Pi 3 B+ for the ***c o r t e x***
2. This (https://www.waveshare.com/motor-driver-hat.htm) motor driver hat (to drive the motors)
3. These (https://amzn.to/2lwtOZO) motors.
4. This (https://amzn.to/2kWVqXN) camera.
5. These (https://bit.ly/2lkfbsJ) wheels for front wheels.
6. And other stuff, but thats the most important stuff.
